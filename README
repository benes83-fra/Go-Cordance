# Go‑Cordance

Go‑Cordance is a lightweight 3D engine prototype written in Go.  
It explores how far Go can be pushed for real‑time graphics, physics, and entity‑component‑system (ECS) style architecture. The project is experimental but already demonstrates meshes, materials, cameras, physics, and shader‑based rendering.

## ✨ Features

- **Entity–Component–System (ECS) architecture**
  - Entities composed of modular components (Mesh, Material, Camera, etc.)
  - Systems update and render components independently

- **Rendering**
  - OpenGL pipeline with GLSL shaders
  - Mesh support (including sphere meshes with normals)
  - Material properties (ambient, diffuse, specular, shininess)
  - Debug overlays (wireframe colliders, bounding boxes)

- **Physics**
  - Basic collision detection and rigid body updates
  - Collider visualization integrated into the render loop

- **Camera**
  - Minimal Camera component and CameraSystem
  - View/projection matrix handling
  - Lighting uniforms passed through camera system

- **Debugging**
  - Toggleable debug rendering system
  - Separate shader for collider visualization
  - Empirical validation of material/shader differences

- **Textures**
  - Simple texture system introduced

- **Mesh Loader**
  - A simple MeshLoader was introduced to load .obj files

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21+ (modules enabled)
- OpenGL drivers (tested with modern desktop GPUs)
- `glfw` and `go-gl` bindings (installed via `go get`)

### Build & Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/benes83-fra/Go-Cordance.git
cd Go-Cordance/cmd/game
go run .

This will launch the demo scene with camera, meshes, and physics enabled.

The camera can be controled WASD + Mouse,
F1 toggles/untoggles Collsion Debugging
F2 toggles/untoggles Lighting Debuggen

The Lightsource rotation can be stopped/started with SPACE
and the arrow keys allow to move the the light independently of the gizmo


🛠 Development Roadmap
Planned improvements:

Texture support (diffuse, normal maps)

Advanced lighting (PBR, shadows)

Expanded physics (joints, constraints)

Scene graph and asset pipeline

Profiling and benchmarking tools

Editor / configuration system

Documentation and tutorials
