Go‑Cordance
A modular, experimental 3D game engine and editor written in Go.

Go‑Cordance is a real‑time 3D engine built around a clean ECS architecture, a modern OpenGL rendering pipeline, a growing asset system, and a live‑linked editor that communicates directly with the running game. The project focuses on clarity, extensibility, and professional‑grade workflows: stable transforms, predictable systems, and an editor that mirrors the runtime state.

Features Overview
Core Architecture
Entity‑Component‑System (ECS)

Simple, explicit component model

Systems for physics, transforms, rendering, camera, billboards, gizmos, debugging, and more

Clean separation between data (components) and behavior (systems)

Scene System

JSON‑based scene format

Load/save scenes (Scene.Save("my_scene.json"))

Named entity lookup for runtime binding

Editor ↔ game synchronization via TCP

Rendering
Modern OpenGL Pipeline
GLSL shader pipeline (vertex, fragment, shadow, debug)

Perspective camera with controller system

MeshManager with built‑in primitives:

Cube, sphere, plane, wireframe shapes

Gizmo primitives (arrows, planes, circles)

Billboard quad

glTF Support
Single‑mesh and multi‑mesh glTF loading

Material extraction (LoadGLTFMaterials)

Automatic VAO/VBO setup

Multi‑material mesh support (e.g., sofa model)

Lighting & Shadows
Multiple light sources

Directional, point, and spotlight variants

Shadow mapping pipeline:

Dedicated shadow shaders

Configurable shadow resolution

Light debug visualization system

Debug Rendering
Toggleable debug overlays

Normal/tangent/bitangent/UV visualization modes

Light direction visualization

Wireframe and collider rendering

Physics
Physics Components
Velocity, Acceleration

AngularVelocity, AngularAcceleration

AngularMass, AngularDamping

Collider Types
Sphere

AABB

Plane

Physics Systems
Force system (e.g., gravity)

Physics integration

Collision detection

Transform propagation

Camera
Camera Component
Position, target, up vector

FOV, near/far, aspect

Active camera selection

Camera Systems
CameraSystem: view/projection calculation

CameraControllerSystem:

WASD movement

Mouse‑look

Cursor‑locked camera mode

FocusOn(entity) support for editor integration

Asset Pipeline (Early Stage)
The engine includes the beginnings of a structured asset pipeline:

Asset Registry
Global registry for:

Textures

Meshes

Materials

Texture Importing
assets.ImportTexture(path)

Stores GPU texture ID in registry

ECS texture component wraps GL ID

Mesh Importing
glTF single‑mesh and multi‑mesh importers

Assets registered with metadata

Material Metadata
Base color

Diffuse/normal texture paths

Future‑proof for shader/material graph integration

Editor
The editor is a separate executable (cmd/editor) that connects to the running game via TCP and provides a live view of the scene.

Editor ↔ Game Link
TCP connection on port 7777

Full scene snapshot transfer

Incremental transform updates

Undo/redo synchronization

Hierarchy Panel
Displays all entities in the scene

Selecting an entity updates the inspector

Selection is synchronized with the game runtime

Inspector
Displays all components on the selected entity

Editable fields for:

Transform

Materials

Billboards

Any component implementing EditorFields()

Writes changes back to the game in real time

Transformation Gizmo
Move / Rotate / Scale / Combined modes

Local vs world rotation

Pivot vs center mode

Drawn using dedicated gizmo meshes

Depth‑independent rendering

Sends transform deltas back to the game

Undo / Redo
Full undo/redo stack

Editor and game stay synchronized

Triggered via keyboard shortcuts (Z/Y)
